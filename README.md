# carShow

// GENERAL
A sample webpage showcasing my knowledge of webdev related technologies, based on final project from Colt Steele's Udemy Course.
Full-stack project, uses nodeJS, Bootstrap (styling), Cloud9 (IDE), mongoDB (database) and more.

// USING THE APPLICATION
Different users can add cars (brand, model, image) and add comments to those "posts." 
User authentication (using passport) means users can only edit/delete their own posts/comments.
